            <h2>History of Indian subcontinent:War of independence 1857</h2>
            <p> The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 as a mutiny of sepoys in the company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859.

The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.

The Indian rebellion was fueled by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, and skepticism about British claims that their rule offered material improvement to the Indian economy. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals. The cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.

After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, where the 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and most of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, including Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British as stabilizing forces.

In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important turning point in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company and forced the British to reorganize the army, financial system, and administration in India through the passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which, while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians would increasingly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.

        <h1>Causes:</h1>
        <p>    The Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred as the result of an accumulation of factors over time, rather than any single event.

The sepoys were Indian soldiers who were recruited into the company's army. Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The East India Company's forces were divided into three presidency armies: Bombay, Madras, and Bengal. The Bengal Army recruited higher castes, such as Brahmins, Rajputs, and Bhumihar, mostly from the Awadh and Bihar regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the Madras Army and Bombay Army were more localized and caste-neutral, without a preference for high-caste men. The dominance of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been considered one of the reasons behind the initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.

In 1772, when Warren Hastings was appointed Fort William's first Governor-General, one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal—many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar—were now viewed with suspicion by the British, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bihar, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. To prevent social friction, the company adapted its military practices to respect religious rituals. Soldiers dined in separate facilities, overseas service was not required to avoid caste pollution, and Hindu festivals were officially recognized. However, this encouragement of high-caste status also made the government vulnerable to protest and mutiny whenever the sepoys felt their privileges were threatened.

After the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys became discontented due to the loss of privileges and the fear of increased land-revenue payments. Some Indian soldiers also believed that the British were trying to convert Hindus and Muslims to Christianity. Earlier social reforms, such as the abolition of sati and the legalization of Hindu widow remarriage, had little effect on the sepoys' loyalty, but changes in service terms created resentment. As the Company's territory expanded through wars and annexations, sepoys were expected to serve in unfamiliar regions, such as Burma, without the extra pay they had previously received for foreign service.

A significant cause of discontent arose with the General Service Enlistment Act of 1856, which required new recruits to the Bengal Army to serve anywhere, including overseas. While this only applied to new recruits, many serving sepoys feared that the rule would eventually extend to them, threatening the tradition of family military service. Promotions were also based on seniority, making advancement slow. The increasing number of British officers in the battalions further limited opportunities for Indian officers, many of whom only reached commissioned ranks late in their careers.

The final spark for the rebellion came from the introduction of the new Enfield Pattern 1853 rifled musket. These rifles used paper cartridges pre-greased with tallow or lard, which sepoys had to bite open before loading. Rumors spread that the grease was derived from beef fat, offensive to Hindus, and pork fat, offensive to Muslims. At least one Company official had warned that this could create problems, but production of greased cartridges still began in 1856. By early 1857, rumors had spread widely, and many sepoys believed that the British were deliberately trying to defile their religious beliefs. The Company attempted to address concerns by allowing sepoys to use their own grease and modifying the loading drill so that cartridges were torn by hand instead of being bitten. However, these measures only reinforced suspicions that the rumors were true.

Reports of an altercation between a high-caste sepoy and a low-caste laborer at Dum Dum added to tensions when the laborer mocked the sepoy for losing his caste by biting the cartridge. This incident fueled the belief that the British sought to destroy Indian religions, and the unrest intensified. The Company quickly attempted to reverse its policy, issuing orders in January 1857 that all cartridges be free of grease and that sepoys could prepare them however they preferred. However, many soldiers remained unconvinced, suspecting that even the cartridge paper was contaminated. A court of inquiry held in February found that sepoys were deeply mistrustful of the new cartridges, believing that their suspicions could not be disproven.

<h1>Civilian Discontent and Rebellion</h1>
<p>The civilian aspect of the rebellion involved three main groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords (taluqdars), and peasants. Many nobles had lost their titles and lands under the Doctrine of Lapse, which prevented adopted children of Indian rulers from inheriting their fathers' thrones. Some rebel leaders, like Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi, were directly affected by this policy. The Rani of Jhansi, for example, was willing to accept British rule if her adopted son was recognized as her heir. In contrast, princely states such as Indore and Sagar, where such losses had not occurred, remained loyal to the British.

The taluqdars had lost large portions of their estates due to British land reforms that favored peasant ownership. In Oudh and Bihar, Rajput taluqdars played a leading role in the rebellion. When the uprising spread, taluqdars quickly reclaimed their lost lands, and peasant farmers—who might have otherwise opposed them—joined the rebellion out of loyalty and kinship. High land-revenue assessments had driven many landowners into debt, making them more inclined to rebel. In addition to the Company, moneylenders were also targeted by rebels, as they were seen as agents of economic oppression.

The civilian rebellion varied in intensity across different regions. Some areas, such as Muzaffarnagar, remained relatively peaceful, despite being close to the center of the uprising in Meerut. In contrast, other parts of north-central India saw widespread resistance to British rule.
The sepoys were Indian soldiers who were recruited into the company's army. Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The East India Company's forces were divided into three presidency armies: Bombay, Madras, and Bengal. The Bengal Army recruited higher castes, such as Brahmins, Rajputs, and Bhumihar, mostly from the Awadh and Bihar regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the Madras Army and Bombay Army were "more localized, caste-neutral armies" that "did not prefer high-caste men." The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.

<h1>Caste Privileges and Military Traditions</h1>
<p>In 1772, when Warren Hastings was appointed Fort William's first Governor-General, one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal—many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar—were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bihar, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognize Hindu festivals. This encouragement of high-caste ritual status left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.</p>
<h1>Economic and Religious Grievances</h1>
<p>After the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about. Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity. Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as William Carey and William Wilberforce had successfully clamored for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of sati and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys' allegiance was affected by this.</p>
<h1>Unrest in April 1857</h1>
<p>During April, there was unrest and fires at Agra, Allahabad, and Ambala. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General's staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to Simla, the cool hill station where many high officials spent the summer.

Although there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings and British officers' bungalows were set on fire.</p>
